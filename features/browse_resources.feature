  Scenario: Max goes to the homepage and want to see his own media entries and public media entries from other users
    Given I am "max"
    When I go to the home page
    Then I should see "My Act Photos"
    And I should see "Me with Nothing"
    And I should see "My Private Images"
    And I should see "My Public Images"
    And I should see "Football Pics"
    And I should see "Images from School"
    And I should see "Photos from Moritz"
    And I should not see "This is Moritz"
    And I should not see "Moritzs private Images"
    And I should not see "Moritz Public"
    And I should not see "Moritzs Profiles"
    And I should not see "Hockey Pics"
    And I should not see "Brackets"
